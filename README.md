The function starts with n empty sequences and lastAnswer set to 0.
For each query, it finds the sequence index using (x ^ lastAnswer) % n.
If the query type is 1, it appends y to that sequence.
If the query type is 2, it finds a value from the sequence, updates lastAnswer, and stores it in results.
Finally, it returns all collected results.
